**Set-up a local python environment [optional]**

**Make sure your computer has virtual environments for Python (see <a href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/">here</a>)**
Virtual environments allow you to create a virtual copy of your machine’s python without affecting the set-up the native python. This way you can download modules/packages without affecting the dependencies for other applications that require python.

on macOs and Linux: ```opython -m pip install —user virtualenv```

on Windows: ```py -m pip install —user virtualenv```

**Setup the environment**
```virtualenv .```
```source bin/activate```
